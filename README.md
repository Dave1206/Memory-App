## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

3. **Install dependencies for the backend**:
```bash
npm install
```

4. **Set up environment variables for the backend**:
- In the root folder, create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file provided.
- Fill in your own values.

5. **Install dependencies for the frontend**:
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

6. **Add server proxy to package.json in the client folder**:
Add the following line to the package.json to create a proxy for the server:
```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:4747"
```

## Usage

1. **Start the backend server**:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
- This will start the backend server on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: 4747).

2. **Start the frontend development server**:
```bash
cd ../client
npm start
```
- This will start the React app, typically available at http://localhost:3000.

3. **Access the app**:
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
- Make sure both the client and server are running simultaneously.

# Create React App Guide

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
